# Employee Registry

This a cadence program demonstrating the implementation of a registry of employees in a company.

## Description

The project has 3 codes: 
Employee.cdc
transactions.cdc 
scripts.cdc 

which implements the Storing and retrival of student's data in cadence playground.

The "Employee.cdc" contains the EmployeeRegistry contract which manages a list of employee records, each represented by a struct containing attributes such as name, age, and position. It provides functions to add new employee records and retrieve details based on an index.

The "transaction.cdc" code interacts with the EmployeeRegistry smart contract, adding a new employee record with specified name, age, and position and logging a confirmation message.

The "scripts.cdc" code retrieves and returns an employee's details from the EmployeeRegistry smart contract based on the specified index.
